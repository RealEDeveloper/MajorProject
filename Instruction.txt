Installation of required tools 

The environment used for development is Remix IDE. Remix IDE is a no-setup tool with a GUI for developing smart contracts.
Remix used well with other tools, and allows for a simple deployment process to the chain of user choice. Remix is famous for its visual debugger.

The compiler used is Solidity Compiler which is an open-source compiler that translates Solidity code into bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
It is written in the Go programming language and is used to compile Solidity code into executable bytecode.

The testnet used is sepolia testnet
Testnets are blockchains designed to mimic the operating environment of a ‘mainnet’ but exist on a separate ledger. These testnets help developers test their applications and smart contracts in a risk-free way before deploying their products to Ethereum’s mainnet environment.
Sepolia was designed to simulate harsh network conditions, and has shorter block times, which enable faster transaction confirmation times and feedback for developers.
Details about the testnet->
Network Name - Sepolia Test Netwok
RPC URL - https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/[YOUR-API-KEY]
Chain ID - 11155111
Currency Symbol - SepoliaETH
Block Explorer URL - https://sepolia.etherscan.io/

The tool or Wallet for doing transaction is MetaMask
MetaMask is a crypto wallet. Just like we have a physical wallet for money, MetaMask is like a digital wallet for cryptocurrencies. Instead of holding coins and bills, it holds digital tokens like Ethereum and makes it easy to interact with DeFi and NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.



Execution of code 

To execute a Solidity file in Remix IDE, the steps are:
Open Remix IDE and create a new file.
Write your Solidity code in the file. For example,  create a simple contract called Lottery:

Compile the contract by clicking the "Compile" button under the Compiler window.
Deploy the contract by clicking the "Deploy" button under the Deploy and Run Transactions window. 

We now connect Ethereum wallet to Remix IDE to deploy your contract.
Now we need to have some ether to execute the transaction 





Modification of Code->

some modifications we can make to the Solidity lottery application:

Add a constructor to the Lottery.sol contract to set the minimum number of participants required to start the lottery:
solidity
